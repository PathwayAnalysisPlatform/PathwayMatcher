* Prevalence of the different PTM annotations in Reactome. PTM labels are extracted from the Reactome database and the number of proteins annotated with the PTM is displayed for each label. If a protein is carrying multiple instances of the PTM, the PTM is counted only once (__Supplementary Figure 1__):
